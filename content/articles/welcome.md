Hello, and welcome to my articles! I'm thrilled to have you here. My name is Jason, and I am the library assistant for electronic resources at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles, California. I am incredibly passionate about the intersection of technology and library science.

In my day-to-day work, I handle a range of tasks, from updating the LibGuides A-Z list and troubleshooting electronic resource access issues to developing custom scripts for metadata harvest. I frequently interface with library stakeholders and vendors to resolve issues, develop systems-based approaches to manage metadata, and create custom scripts for ensuring metadata compliance. Additionally, I’ve been involved in creating procedural documentation, analyzing workflows, and spearheading assessments to improve acquisition workflows, especially after our Integrated Library System (ILS) migration.

### What to Expect

Through this blog, I aim to share insights and experiences from my journey. Here are some of the topics you can look forward to:

- **Database Management:** Tips and tricks for smoothly transitioning databases and keeping your LibGuides A-Z list updated, including insights into LibGuides APIs and other programmatic tools.
- **Navigating ExLibris Tools:** Practical advice and insights on utilizing the ExLibris Integrated Library System (ILS) Alma and the Discovery service Primo, including how to use Alma APIs to manage various aspects of acquisitions data and workflows.
- **Metadata Magic:** How to develop and use custom scripts for harvesting metadata and ensuring compliance with internal control schemas.
- **Technical Services Workflow Optimization:** Strategies for creating procedural documentation and analyzing workflows to streamline processes and improve efficiency.
- **Research Data Tools and Workflows:** Exploring the use of personal knowledge management systems like Obsidian and well-known citation managers such as Zotero to enhance research data management and streamline your research and publication pipeline.
- **Project Highlights:** Behind-the-scenes looks at active projects and forthcoming publications.
- **Professional Development:** Reflections on my career journey and professional growth.

### Get Involved

I hope these articles will not only be a place for me to share my experiences but also a space for us to engage in meaningful conversations about the evolving world of technical services in libraries.

Thank you for joining me on this adventure. I can’t wait to share more with you and hear your thoughts along the way. Stay tuned for my first post, where I’ll dive deeper into the world of electronic resource management and share some practical tips to help you streamline your processes.

Happy reading!

Jason
