## Hey there ðŸ‘‹, I'm [Jason!](https://github.com/CompareTheo/)
### Glad to see you here!

Welcome to my digital gardenâ€”a space where I cultivate and share my evolving projects, research, and ideas. As the Library Assistant for Electronic Resources at Loyola Marymount University, I work at the intersection of library technology and problem-solving, managing the life cycle of electronic and continuing resources. My role includes developing custom scripts for metadata harvesting, ensuring compliance with internal metadata standards, and troubleshooting access and management challenges.

This site highlights my work and research in library technical services, where I focus on streamlining workflows, enhancing metadata quality, and supporting access to academic resources. Iâ€™m passionate about the "behind-the-scenes work" that ensures library collections are accessible, reliable, and adaptable to changing technologies and user needs.

Feel free to browse, ask questions, or connect with me to discuss ideas, share insights, or explore potential collaborations. You can also view my CV for a snapshot of my professional experience and background.
