## Hey there ðŸ‘‹, I'm [Jason!](https://github.com/CompareTheo/)
### Glad to see you here!

I am the Library Assistant for Electronic Resources at Loyola Marymount University, where I help manage the life-cycle processes for electronic and continuing resources. I develop custom scripts for harvesting metadata from vendor systems and ensure compliance with our internal metadata control schema. Additionally, I serve as the primary point of contact for troubleshooting electronic resource access and metadata management issues.

I have a passion for problem-solving and thrive on the challenge of making library technology more accessible and inclusive. My research interests include data science, big data analytics, knowledge management, natural language processing, and computational analysis.
