      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello, and welcome to my articles! I&amp;rsquo;m thrilled to have you here. My name is Jason, and I am the library assistant for electronic resources at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles, California. I am incredibly passionate about the intersection of technology and library science.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In my day-to-day work, I handle a range of tasks, from updating the LibGuides A-Z list and troubleshooting electronic resource access issues to developing custom scripts for metadata harvest. I frequently interface with library stakeholders and vendors to resolve issues, develop systems-based approaches to manage metadata, and create custom scripts for ensuring metadata compliance. Additionally, Iâ€™ve been involved in creating procedural documentation, analyzing workflows, and spearheading assessments to improve acquisition workflows, especially after our Integrated Library System (ILS) migration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
