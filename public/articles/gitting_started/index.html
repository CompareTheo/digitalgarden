          <p>As someone who spends a significant amount of time managing metadata, troubleshooting electronic resource access, and creating custom tools for library workflows, scripting has become an indispensable part of my professional toolkit. Early in my journey, I made the decision to adopt Python as my primary scripting language, a choice that has shaped how I approach problem-solving and automation in technical services. But like any decision, it’s worth revisiting periodically to ensure it still aligns with my needs and goals. Lately, I’ve been broadening my horizons, exploring other scripting languages, particularly Bash, and reflecting on what Python offers compared to other tools.</p>

      <p>Hello again, and welcome to another post on my journey through the world of technical services and scripting! I’m Jason, and today I’m excited to talk about something that’s become an essential part of my workflow: using Git to back up my Python scripts.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re new to Git, you&rsquo;re in good company. It can be a bit intimidating at first, but once you understand the basics, you’ll see how powerful and indispensable it is for version control and backing up your code. In this post, I’ll walk you through how I got started using Git to back up my Python scripts and why it’s a game changer for anyone developing software, no matter how simple or complex.</p>
<h3 id="why-should-you-use-git">Why Should You Use Git?</h3>
<p>Before we dive into the steps, let’s take a quick look at why Git is so helpful, especially for Python scripts:</p>
<p><strong>Version Control:</strong> Git keeps track of every change you make to your scripts. If you mess something up, you can easily go back to an earlier version. This is incredibly useful for debugging and keeping your code organized.</p>
<p><strong>Collaboration:</strong> If you work in a team or even just share scripts with others, Git makes it easy to collaborate. You can sync changes with teammates without worrying about conflicting code.</p>
<p><strong>Backup Your Work:</strong> Having your Python scripts stored in a Git repository ensures that you always have a backup. Whether you&rsquo;re coding on a local machine or working remotely, your code is safely stored in the cloud (if you&rsquo;re using a service like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket).</p>
<h3 id="how-to-get-started-with-git">How to Get Started with Git</h3>
<p>Now that we’ve covered the basics, let’s get you set up with Git to back up your Python scripts.</p>
<ol>
<li>Install Git
First things first, you’ll need to install Git on your machine. If you don’t have it yet, you can download it from the official Git website.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once installed, open your terminal and run this command to check if Git is properly installed:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>git --version
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This will display the installed Git version. If it shows up correctly, you&rsquo;re all set!</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Set Up Your Git Configuration
Next, you&rsquo;ll want to set up your Git configuration. In the terminal, type the following commands to configure your name and email (this is important for tracking your commits):</li>
</ol>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>git config --global user.name <span style="color:#f1fa8c">&#34;Your Name&#34;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>git config --global user.email <span style="color:#f1fa8c">&#34;your_email@example.com&#34;</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This info will be used to label your commits, so make sure it’s correct.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Create a Git Repository
Now, let’s get to the fun part: creating a repository for your Python scripts.
Navigate to the directory where your Python project is located using the terminal. For example:</li>
</ol>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span><span style="color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic">cd</span> path/to/your/project
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Then, initialize a Git repository by running:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>git init
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This will create a new .git folder in your project directory, signaling that Git is now tracking this folder.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Add Files to Git
Once your repository is set up, you can start adding your Python scripts to Git. First, check the status of your project:</li>
</ol>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>git status
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>You’ll see a list of files that are untracked (meaning Git hasn’t started tracking them yet). To add these files, use the git add command. For example, to add all the files in your project, run:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>git add .
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This will stage all files in your project for the next commit.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Commit Your Changes
Once you’ve added your files, you can commit them to your local repository. A commit is a snapshot of your project at a specific point in time. To commit your changes, use the following command:</li>
</ol>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>git commit -m <span style="color:#f1fa8c">&#34;Initial commit of my Python scripts&#34;</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The -m flag lets you add a message that describes what changes you made. In this case, we’re simply stating that it’s the initial commit.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>Create a Remote Repository (e.g., on GitHub)
At this point, your code is safely stored in a local Git repository. But, for real peace of mind, you&rsquo;ll want to back it up remotely. Services like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket offer free repositories where you can push your code.</li>
</ol>
<p>To create a GitHub repository, simply go to GitHub, sign in, and create a new repository. After that, follow the instructions on GitHub to link your local repository to the remote one. It’ll look something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Then, push your changes to GitHub:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="display:flex;"><span>git push -u origin master
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Now, your Python scripts are safely backed up on GitHub!</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>Keep Your Code Up-to-Date
From here on out, as you continue to work on your Python scripts, you’ll want to commit and push your changes regularly. Here’s a quick recap of the commands you’ll use:
<strong>Add changes:</strong> git add .
<strong>Commit changes:</strong> git commit -m &ldquo;Description of changes&rdquo;
<strong>Push to GitHub:</strong> git push</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="best-practices-for-using-git">Best Practices for Using Git</h3>
<p>As you continue to use Git, here are a few best practices to keep in mind:</p>
<p><strong>Commit Frequently:</strong> Don’t wait until the end of a project to commit your changes. Committing frequently allows you to track your progress and makes it easier to debug if something goes wrong.</p>
<p><strong>Write Meaningful Commit Messages:</strong> A good commit message should briefly explain what changes you’ve made. This will help you (and others) understand the history of your code.</p>
<p><strong>Use Branches:</strong> If you’re working on new features or experimenting, create a new branch. This keeps your main branch stable while you work on changes.</p>
<p><strong>Sync Often:</strong> Push your changes to your remote repository regularly. This ensures that your code is backed up and easily accessible from any device.</p>
<h3 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h3>
<p>Starting to use Git to back up your Python scripts has been one of the best decisions I’ve made in my programming journey. It’s a powerful tool that not only keeps your code safe but also allows you to collaborate with others and manage versions efficiently.</p>
<p>I hope this post helps you get started with Git, and I encourage you to integrate it into your workflow if you haven’t already. Git can feel overwhelming at first, but once you get the hang of it, you’ll wonder how you ever worked without it.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading, and happy coding!</p>
